The goal is to build a site that can search the Etsy catalog, via their API, and display the results to the user.  You should be able to search for a subset of the Etsy products and the results should be sortable.  Along with displaying a list of items, there should be a way to get more information about each item, images and a way to remove an item from the list of products.  Give some thought to what is bookmarkable.
 
This is a front end code test and presentation is important.  Show off your abilities to make the page look better.  Include in the readme which browser the page looks best in; we want to see your best.  If you write tests for your code, include those in the project and how we can run them in the readme.  The entire code needs to be client side, the only exception is anything needed to serve static files.  When we evaluate the code, we will be using our own static serving.
 
Some parts of the code test are intentionally ambiguous. (e.g. ‘sortable’) Use your best judgement given the nature of the project and include in the readme why you made those choices.  If you find anything confusing though, please reach out to us and ask questions.  To deliver the finished code test, make a repo (GitHub, BitBucket, etc.) and share with the team.  It’s helpful for us if you commit as you work.  That will help us see how you work.  All quality-type evaluations will only apply to the final commit though.
